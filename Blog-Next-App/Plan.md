Here I will list out all the thought process while I will be building this app and keep you guys updated what goes in my mind and how do I proceed with the app.

1. First set up the routes which your app will be going to have. - for the time being I will only have main 4 routes such as -

   - Main Homepage
   - posts page -- which will then have two specifics
     - one is the main posts page where we list out all the blogs...
     - other being the slug page for individual posts.
   - contact me page
   - Also can add About me page..

2. Now once this is done, we can now focus upon how our UI is going to look like.

   - Let's start with the Homepage - This I will see and design on FIgma and then will try to implement on NextUI.
   - Then Design the ContactMe page.
   - And AllPosts and SinglePosts Page as well.

3. Home Page will have 2 main sections:

   a. The Hero Section...

   b. The Featured Posts section. - For now we can show some dummy data, then we can move forward with linking in the future.

4. So, I have not yet designed the Hero Section but I have gone with the basic template for Hero Section with an image and a h1 text.

5. Currently working on Featured Posts component.

6. I have also deisgned the Navbar which i have implemented, looks great though!

7. I will have to change the PostGrid and PostItem as per what i will need, but for now I think It's good.

8. I have designed a basic structure of how the Blog post would look like and I think I will continue with that as of now. Later maybe if different design idea comes, I might change my mind...

9. All posts page and Home page are done, I have to tweak the design bit here and there but I think I will leave it for last and for now just complete the basic setting up all the routes and data in there.

10. I have to design the Single post page from scratch... Very bad design as of now...

11. Writing JSX with markdown : package used : react-markdown - very handy while using Markdowns..
