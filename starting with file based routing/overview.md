# OVERVIEW OF THIS PROJECT:

## One of the major key features that Nextjs applies over React are :

<ul>
    <li> File Based Routing</li>
    <li> Server Side Rendering </li>
    <li> Full Stack Capabilities</li>
</ul>

### Here we are going to target 1. File Based Routing in NEXT JS.

- Understanding File based routing.
- Static and Dynamic Routing.
- How to Navigate between pages.

In Next js, we dont use react-router-dom package and neither do we write any jsx or js codes as such for designing and defining our routes.
Instead we use special feature that next js provides - Create React Components files and let Nextjs infer the routes from the folder structure and for that we use a special folder `/page` which next interprets that every js/jsx/ts/tsx file present there will be a page component.
